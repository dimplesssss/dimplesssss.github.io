        <p>I believe everyone has unique skills and talents, and that is what makes each one of us special. 
          People have skills in areas such as playing an instrument, playing sports,
           being artistic, acting, singing, and many more.
           People realize their talents at different stages in their lives.
           Giving back to the community by sharing the skill I have is what makes the difference</p>

          <h2>Communication Skills</h2>
          <p> Communication skills are important for anyone in IT, as information technology students are 
            often required to work across many teams and groups, 
            and they often have to provide tech solutions for people who aren't as savvy.</p>

          <h2>Knowledge in Computer Networks</h2>
          <p>Knowledge networking is an extension of good communication skills, as it requires gathering groups of people in a working environment to share what they
             know in order to build a system of knowledge within an organization that is more than the sum of its parts.</p>

          <h2>Time Management and Project Management</h2>
          <p>You need to be self-directed and self-motivated,
             and a big part of self-directed work means having the ability to manage projects well. 
             Work in technology can often take longer than anticipated, as proven by how often timelines and milestones change over the course of a long project.</p>

          <div class="icon"><img src="img/icon4.png" /></div>
          <h2>Coding Skills</h2>
          <p> One of the basic skills is the ability to write code, and one should also have an understanding of the process of
             writing code in order to see a software development project through and manage things like quality assurance.</p>
